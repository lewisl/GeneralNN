These are results of some performance tests.

1. Set type of elements of Batch_view to Array{AbstractArray{Float64,2},1}

	Training time: 31.0 seconds   No Benefit

	vs: Set type of elements to Array Any

	Training time: 30.2 seconds

2. Update container arrays in update_batch_views!

	Training time: 30.9 No benefit

3. Split minibatch by slicing instead of view
	
	Training time: 71 seconds MUCH WORSE
